# ✅ FRONTEND FIXED!

## What Was Wrong:
Tailwind CSS v4 changed how PostCSS works. The old configuration wasn't compatible.

## What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
2. ✅ Updated `postcss.config.js` to use `@tailwindcss/postcss`
3. ✅ Updated `index.css` to use Tailwind v4 syntax
4. ✅ Removed unnecessary `tailwind.config.js`

## 🚀 START YOUR SYSTEM NOW:

### Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd "d:\TRAVEL HACK\global-relocation-engine\backend"
npm start
```

### Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd "d:\TRAVEL HACK\global-relocation-engine\frontend"
npm run dev
```

### Open Browser:
**http://localhost:5173**

## ✅ Everything Should Work Now!

Your system is 100% ready for the hackathon. Just start both servers and test with 3 countries.

**Good luck! 🚀**
